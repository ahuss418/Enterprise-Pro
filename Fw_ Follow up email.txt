Many thanks for the email below and attachment

Please use the following links , please note that the datasets does not have to be postcode that was just an example it can be any dataset that has a longitude and latitude

https://datahub.bradford.gov.uk/

or

https://datamillnorth.org/

here some final suggestions before I can sign off, please make sure its signed by yourself or the team lead before sending it back with the updates,

Here are some final suggestions

1. User Experience & Accessibility
Ensure mobile responsiveness for users accessing the platform on smaller screens.
Consider auto-suggestions in search functionality to enhance usability.
Include error handling for incorrect inputs (e.g., invalid asset searches or CSV format errors).
Define how bulk actions (e.g., batch approvals, rejections, or deletions) will be handled for efficiency.

2. Data Handling & Integration
Specify the maximum CSV file size the system can handle.
Clarify data validation rules (e.g., missing lat/long handling, duplicates, incorrect formats).
If an API is integrated for real-time updates, define rate limits and error handling policies.

3. Performance & Scalability
Define expected system load (e.g., number of concurrent users and assets displayed).
Consider lazy loading or caching mechanisms to optimize map performance.
If asset counts grow significantly, how will the system prevent slowdowns (e.g., database indexing, optimized queries)?

4. Security Enhancements
Specify session timeout durations for inactive users.
Ensure role-based access control (RBAC) is detailed (e.g., granular permissions for admins).
Consider audit logs for tracking admin/user actions.

5. Testing & Quality Assurance
Define specific testing tools or frameworks for unit and load testing.
Mention cross-browser compatibility testing for various devices and browsers.

Thanks

Hi there,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to follow up on my previous email regarding the Requirements document - we’re still awaiting your signature to move forward.

As we have a tight two-week turnaround to produce the prototype, we need the green light as soon as possible to stay on schedule. Please let me know if you have any questions or need any adjustments.

Looking forward to your response. Appreciate your prompt attention!
